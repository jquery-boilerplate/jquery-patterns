    # window and document are passed through as local
    # variables rather than as globals, because this (slightly)
    # quickens the resolution process and can be more
    # efficiently minified (especially when both are
    # regularly referenced in your plugin).

        # contents of two or more objects, storing the
        # result in the first object. The first object
        # is generally empty because we don't want to alter
        # the default options for future instances of the plugin

            # and this.options
            # you can add more functions like the one below and
            # call them like so: this.yourOtherFunction(this.element, this.options).
